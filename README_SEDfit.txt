This is a FORTRAN code to determine the parameters of CCSN progenitors using their AB magnitudes.

If you are working on a Windows system, you can run SEDfit_preCCSN.exe directly. Otherwise, if you are working on other systems, you need to compile the SEDfit_preCCSN.f file first.

The parameters will be determined by two kinds of stellar models, i.e., single and binary models.
When you do not want to use a input parameter, or you do not have the corresponding data, set it as -99.0.
