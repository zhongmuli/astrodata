This is a database of the fundamental parameters and color-magnitude diagrams of 49 star clusters. 
It corresponds to the study of Zhongmu Li, Yangyang Deng and Jing Chen in 2021, which was submitted to ApJS. When one use these data, please cite to that work.  
The fundamental parameters are fitted from the color-magnitude diagrams in V and I bands, via the ASPS model and Poerful CMD code. 
The V and I magnitudes are transformed from the Gaia DR2 magnitudes using some fitting correlations. 

The database contains three parts, i.e., a parameter file and three directories. They are explained as follows.

The file "parameters.dat" gives the basic information, best-fit parameters from ASPS model and isochrones. 
There are 15 columns in this file. The colums are for Name, FoF_ID, l, l_err, b, b_err, m-M, E(V-I), Z, t, f_b, f_r, Z_old, t_old, t_old_err respectively. 
They correspond to the contents of a manuscript that was submitted to ApJS.

The directory "obseved_cmds_data" contains the data of observed VI band color-magnitude diagrams of 49 star clusters. 
The first and second columns are for V magnitude and (V-I) color, respectively.

The directory "bestfit_cmds_data" contains the data of best-fit color-magnitude diagrams of 49 star clusters. 
The first and second columns are for (V-I) color and V magnitude respectively.

The directory "cmds_figs" contains the comparison figures of the observed and best-fit color-magnitude diagrams.
